# The Damerau-Levenshtein distance

> [Elasticsearch] uses the Damerau-Levenshtein distance to find all terms with a maximum of two changes, where a change is the insertion, deletion or substitution of a single character, or transposition of two adjacent characters.

> The default edit distance is 2, but an edit distance of 1 should be sufficient to catch 80% of all human misspellings
